# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting up Otto's repository for the 100-day challenge.

**Thoughts:** Rewriting Otto's documentation in English will take a while, but it will probably be beneficial in the long run. Will start from scratch again. Unsure whether I should consider design and documentation "coding" per se, so I won't; I'll just get to the code and see what comes naturally.
