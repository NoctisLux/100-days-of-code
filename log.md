# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting up Otto's repository for the 100-day challenge.

**Thoughts:** Rewriting Otto's documentation in English will take a while, but it will probably be beneficial in the long run. Will start from scratch again. Unsure whether I should consider design and documentation "coding" per se, so I won't; I'll just get to the code and see what comes naturally.

### Day 1: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Wrote the first few classes of Otto (Event, Task) and tests.

**Thoughts:** That was surprisingly easy. I ignore if getting to work was simpler than I expected thanks to the literal months of thought and notes I spent on this project, or if it's just better to just get to work for a project of that scale. Took roughly an hour plus a few minutes here and there to rewrite minor stuff.
